# Traific
Traific is a Unity-based multiclient traffic and driving simulator to connect human and artificial drivers and study the traffic quality.

# Updates
**Leo:** Multiplayer, networking, server-side logic, and data collection pipeline features completed. Working on physics, baking HDRP car models.
<br>
**Urja + Chintan:** Working on a script to procedurally create a traffic grid from a GeoJSON file.
<br>
**Jay:** Onboarded, working on the camera component.

## 2D version (legacy)
The idea was to start with a 2D environment and develop it into a 3D one. We decided to stop any 2D efforts and focus on a 3D project.

## 3D version
Currently, we are using a karting game project as template to kick-off the 3D simulator.
