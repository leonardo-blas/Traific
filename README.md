# Traific
Traific is a Unity-based multiclient traffic and driving simulator to concurrently connect human and artificial drivers in the same environment.
<br>
This simulator will be used in experiments in which subjects drive alongside agents. Driving data will be recorded and used to make conclusions about the traffic quality when fully autonomous vehicles are present on the traffic grid.
<br>
Due to Git LFS quotas, the project files will be stored elsewhere temporarily.

# Updates
**Leo:** Multiplayer, networking, server-side logic, and data collection pipeline features completed. Simple deployment and multiplayer tests succeeded. Working on ghost car prefabs and a windshield view.
<br>
**Chintan:** Working on a script to procedurally create a traffic grid from a GeoJSON file.

## v0.0
The idea was to start with a 2D environment and develop it into a 3D one. We decided to stop any 2D efforts and focus on a 3D project.

## v0.1
The idea was to use a karting game template and develop the networking features from scratch. The networking code was much more complex than expected. We decided to look for templates that had basic out-of-the-box networking funcitonalities.

## v0.2 (current)
The idea is to use a Unity template that has basic server-based networking functionalities and shape it into our simulator.
